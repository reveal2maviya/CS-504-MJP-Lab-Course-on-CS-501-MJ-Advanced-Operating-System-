# C Programming Practical Assignments (Programs will be added shortly!!)

This repository contains solutions to a series of practical assignments in C programming. Each assignment is briefly described below.

## Assignments

1. **Create a file with a hole in it.**
2. **Take multiple files as Command Line Arguments and print their inode number.**
3. **Find file properties such as inode number, number of hard links, File permissions, File size, File access and modification time, and so on using stat() system call.**
4. **Print the type of file where the file name is accepted through the Command Line.**
5. **Find whether a given file is present in the current directory or not.**
6. **Find all files that begin with a given string in the current directory.**
7. **Read the current directory and display the names of the files and the number of files in the current directory.**
8. **Receive file names as command line arguments and display them in ascending order according to their sizes.**
9. **Display all the files in the current directory that were created in a particular month.**
10. **Display all the files in the current directory whose size is greater than n Bytes, where n is accepted from the user.**
11. **Demonstrate redirection of standard output to a file.**
12. **List all subdirectories in alphabetical order from the current directory.**
13. **Redirect standard output to a file using dup and open system calls.**
14. **Identify the type of a given file using stat() system call.**
15. **Generate a parent process to write to an unnamed pipe, and read from it.**
16. **Handle two-way communication between parent and child processes using a pipe.**
17. **Demonstrate the use of the atexit() function.**
18. **Demonstrate different behaviors of variables (automatic, global, register, static, and volatile) using setjmp() and longjmp() system calls.**
19. **Implement the unix/linux command: ls -l | wc -l.**
20. **Create n child processes. When all n child processes terminate, display the total cumulative time children spent in user and kernel mode.**
21. **Create an unnamed pipe. The child process writes messages to the pipe, and the parent process displays them.**
22. **Get and set resource limits, such as files and memory, associated with a process.**
23. **Execute two commands concurrently with a pipe.**
24. **Print the exit status of a terminated child process.**
25. **Catch the ctrl-c (SIGINT) signal and display the appropriate message, and exit on pressing ctrl-c again.**
26. **Create a child process, handle SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGQUIT signals. The parent process sends signals to terminate the child process.**
27. **Send SIGALRM signal by child process to parent process, and the parent process displays that the alarm is fired.**
28. **Suspend and resume processes using signals.**
29. **Create a child process with signal handling, and the parent process sends signals to terminate the child process.**
30. **Implement the unix/linux command: ls -l | wc -l.**
31. **Create a child process to run a linux/unix command or any user-defined program, with signal handling.**
