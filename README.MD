![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

This repository contains solutions to a series of practical assignments in C programming. Each assignment is briefly described below.

## Assignments

1. [**Create a file with a hole in it.**](AQ01.c)
2. [**Take multiple files as Command Line Arguments and print their inode number.**](AQ02.c)
3. [**Find file properties such as inode number, number of hard links, File permissions, File size, File access and modification time, and so on using stat() system call.**](AQ03.c)
4. [**Print the type of file where the file name is accepted through the Command Line.**](AQ04.c)
5. [**Find whether a given file is present in the current directory or not.**](AQ05.c)
6. [**Find all files that begin with a given string in the current directory.**](AQ06.c)
7. [**Read the current directory and display the names of the files and the number of files in the current directory.**](AQ07.c)
8. [**Receive file names as command line arguments and display them in ascending order according to their sizes.**](AQ08.c)
9. [**Display all the files in the current directory that were created in a particular month.**](AQ09.c)
10. [**Display all the files in the current directory whose size is greater than n Bytes, where n is accepted from the user.**](AQ10.c)
11. [**Demonstrate redirection of standard output to a file.**](AQ11.c)
12. [**List all subdirectories in alphabetical order from the current directory.**](AQ12.c)
13. [**Redirect standard output to a file using dup and open system calls.**](AQ13.c)
14. [**Identify the type of a given file using stat() system call.**](AQ14.c)
15. [**Generate a parent process to write to an unnamed pipe, and read from it.**](AQ15.c)
16. [**Handle two-way communication between parent and child processes using a pipe.**](AQ16.c)
17. [**Demonstrate the use of the atexit() function.**](AQ17.c)
18. [**Demonstrate different behaviors of variables (automatic, global, register, static, and volatile) using setjmp() and longjmp() system calls.**](AQ18.c)
19. [**Implement the unix/linux command: ls -l | wc -l.**](AQ19.c)
20. [**Create n child processes. When all n child processes terminate, display the total cumulative time children spent in user and kernel mode.**](AQ20.c)
21. [**Create an unnamed pipe. The child process writes messages to the pipe, and the parent process displays them.**](AQ21.c)
22. [**Get and set resource limits, such as files and memory, associated with a process.**](AQ22.c)
23. [**Execute two commands concurrently with a pipe.**](AQ23.c)
24. [**Print the exit status of a terminated child process.**](AQ24.c)
25. [**Catch the ctrl-c (SIGINT) signal and display the appropriate message, and exit on pressing ctrl-c again.**](AQ25.c)
26. [**Create a child process, handle SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGQUIT signals. The parent process sends signals to terminate the child process.**](AQ26.c)
27. [**Send SIGALRM signal by child process to parent process, and the parent process displays that the alarm is fired.**](AQ27.c)
28. [**Suspend and resume processes using signals.**](AQ28.c)
29. [**Create a child process with signal handling, and the parent process sends signals to terminate the child process.**](AQ29.c)
30. [**Implement the unix/linux command: ls -l | wc -l.**](AQ30.c)
31. [**Create a child process to run a linux/unix command or any user-defined program, with signal handling.**](AQ31.c)
